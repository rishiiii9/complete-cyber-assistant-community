# Dokploy Deployment - Final Steps

## âœ… Issues Fixed
1. **Port Conflict**: Changed frontend from port 3000 to 8080
2. **Image Pull Error**: Verified correct image names and availability
3. **Docker Compose**: Created `docker-compose-dokploy.yml` with all fixes

## ðŸš€ Ready for Dokploy Deployment

### Step 1: Use the Correct Compose File
In your Dokploy dashboard, use this compose file:
```
docker-compose-dokploy.yml
```

### Step 2: Verify Images are Available
The following images are confirmed available in GitHub Container Registry:
- `ghcr.io/rishiiii9/complete-cyber-backend:latest`
- `ghcr.io/rishiiii9/complete-cyber-frontend:latest`

### Step 3: Dokploy Configuration
- **Compose File**: `docker-compose-dokploy.yml`
- **Frontend Port**: 8080
- **Backend Port**: 8000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (internal)

### Step 4: Access Your Application
After successful deployment:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-dokploy-domain.com:8080`
- **Backend API**: `https://your-dokploy-domain.com:8000`

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Port Conflict Resolution
- Frontend now uses port 8080 instead of 3000
- Updated all environment variables to reference port 8080
- Modified frontend Dockerfile to expose port 8080

### Image Availability
- Confirmed images exist in GitHub Container Registry
- Verified pull access works correctly
- Updated compose file with correct image references

### Service Dependencies
- Database health checks ensure proper startup order
- Backend waits for database to be healthy
- Frontend waits for backend to start
- Huey waits for both database and backend

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Use `docker-compose-dokploy.yml` in Dokploy
- [ ] Ensure port 8080 is available on your Dokploy instance
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs for any issues
- [ ] Test frontend access at port 8080
- [ ] Test backend API at port 8000

## ðŸ†˜ If Issues Persist
1. Check Dokploy logs for specific error messages
2. Verify network connectivity to GitHub Container Registry
3. Ensure ports 8080 and 8000 are not blocked
4. Check if Dokploy has sufficient resources for all services
